# Yield Optimizer

Welcome to the Yield Optimizer documentation. This project enables users to earn yield on stablecoins through AI-powered strategy selection and secure, vault-based fund allocation.

Our system is built with a modular, secure, and intelligent architecture that integrates:

* **On-chain USDC vaults**, governed by a multi-signature wallet for secure fund custody
* **User-selected risk levels**, allowing deposits into either low-risk or high-risk strategies
* **An AI agent powered by [ElizaOS](https://eliza.network/)**, which analyzes real-time DeFi market conditions using data from CoinGecko, DeFiLlama, and other sources to recommend optimal yield strategies
* **Chainlink Automation**, which executes the AI agent's selected strategy on-chain by allocating user funds to the most suitable yield pool

By combining smart contract security with intelligent off-chain automation, Yield Optimizer provides a robust and adaptive platform for maximizing yieldâ€”whether you're risk-averse or yield-seeking.
